    "SQL databases has over the last decades been the core norm of persisting data into non-volatile memory. Although SQL is a great way to represent certain data sets, it can be quite time expensive when queries starts to compute a high number of large cartesian products between tables. To mitigate some of these performance problems, there has been an increasing interest within the area of NoSQL (i.e. a database that is not meant to have normalized relations). MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database and provides a schema-less persistency of the data in a json-like format (called bson). In contrary to SQL, the data in a NoSQL database should be denormalized as much as possible (that is, you should store it wihin a nested structure). This makes MongoDB especially interesting when storing large documents or highly detailed log-files with a high throughput."
